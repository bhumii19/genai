THEORY- 
This code is based on the concept of the **normal distribution** and **histograms**. 
A normal distribution is a continuous probability distribution shaped like a bell curve, where most values lie close to the mean and fewer values appear farther away. 
The spread of the data is controlled by the standard deviation: a smaller value makes the curve narrower, while a larger one makes it wider.
A histogram is a graphical representation of data distribution. It divides the data into intervals (bins) and shows the frequency of values in each bin as bars. 
This helps visualize how data points are spread out and whether they follow a certain pattern, such as a normal distribution.
In this code, two groups of normally distributed data are generated with different means and standard deviations. 
Plotting them on the same histogram allows comparison of their centers and spreads, making it clear how differently the two groups are distributed.
